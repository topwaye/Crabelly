The Crabelly Operating System Project

Back to old time, I had a big dream to build a computer operating system. I was too young to understand how I would carry out something so complicated. The dream was still there, but I was not. It seemed the dream could never ever come true, until I got an inspiration from math. I love math, very good at it.

The kernel is a mathematical model which is called Trapezoid-set. Trapezoid-set is the root logic behind the kernel.

Crabs, nasty things, but delicious. We call this new OS Crabelly.

Crabelly is based on the Mach Operating System project at Carnegie-Mellon University.
