The Crabelly Operating System Project

Back to old time, I had a big dream to build a computer operating system. I was too young to understand how I could carry out something so complicated. The dream was still there, but I was not. It seemed the dream would never ever come true, until I got an inspiration from math. I love math, very good at it.

The kernel is a mathematical model which is called Trapezoid Set. Trapezoid Set is the root logic behind the kernel, which is exactly what the kernel looks like.

Crabs, nasty things, but delicious. We call this new OS Crabelly.

Crabelly is based on the Unix Operating System project at Carnegie-Mellon University.

Crabelly runs on both uniprocessor and multiprocessor computers connected by networks, ranging from smart phones to personal home systems. Crabelly is designed to provide advanced kernel facilities, in particular, virtual memory management and network communication.

Designing, implementing, and testing an operating system as large and complex as Unix is quite a challenge.

I would like to thank those who take the time to learn about my work and provide me with valuable feedback on how it could be improved.

I would also like to take this chance to say to those who are dreaming big: Go for it.
